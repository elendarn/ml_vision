## Animal Recognition with Convolutional Neural Network

This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) capable of recognizing two specific animals: Pandas and Cats. The objective is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately identify and classify images of these animals.

### Project Overview
The key steps involved in this project are as follows:

1. **Image Dataset Collection**: An image dataset containing pictures of Pandas and Cats is collected from a reliable source, such as Kaggle. This dataset will serve as the foundation for training and evaluating the performance of the neural network.

2. **Building a Neural Network from Scratch**: An Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is constructed from scratch using appropriate deep learning frameworks. The network architecture is designed to handle image classification tasks effectively and is tailored to the characteristics of the animal recognition problem.

3. **Training the Neural Network**: To train the neural network, a pre-built image dataset, such as the popular MNIST dataset (handwritten digits), is utilized. This step involves optimizing the network's weights and biases through techniques like backpropagation and gradient descent.

4. **Image Processing and Pre-processing**: The collected animal images are read in and processed to prepare them for input into the machine learning model. This may involve resizing, normalization, or other transformations to align with the network's requirements.

5. **Predictions with Pre-trained Network**: A pre-trained neural network, such as a convolutional neural network (CNN) that exhibits high accuracy in image recognition tasks, is employed to make predictions on the animal images. By leveraging transfer learning, the network can recognize and classify Pandas and Cats effectively.

6. **Fine-tuning a Pre-trained Network**: The pre-trained network is fine-tuned to improve its performance specifically for the animal recognition task. This involves adapting the network's parameters to better align with the characteristics of the collected animal dataset.
